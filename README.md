# Lost boarding pass

### Problem description
On a sold-out flight, N people line up to board the plane. The first passenger in the line has lost his boarding pass but was allowed in regardless. He takes a random seat. Each subsequent passenger takes their assigned seat if available, or a random unoccupied seat, otherwise.
What is the probability that the last passenger to board the plane finds their seat unoccupied?
